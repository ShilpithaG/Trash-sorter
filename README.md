# Autonomous Trash Sorter
This project aims to automate waste segregation using robotic vision, enhancing environmental cleanliness and human health. By integrating a conveyor belt, Franka Research 3 robot arm, Intel RealSense D35 camera system, and control systems like Raspberry Pi and laptop, we streamline the trash sorting process. Leveraging deep learning algorithms such as YOLO V8 and the TACO dataset, the system efficiently segregates trash based on biodegradability.

Key Achievements
